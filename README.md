# Gender-Inequality-Analysis
Built a story, identified data pattern &amp; trends, generated interactive dashboards using multiple large complex data sets to display gender inequality &amp; provided solutions to reduce gender gap

Project Description:
Gender refers to the economic, social, political, and cultural attributes and opportunities associated with being women and men. The social definitions of what it means to be a woman, or a man vary among cultures, and they change over time. Despite the region and country we live in, we have witnessed males and females being treated differently from birth for ages everywhere. Therefore, I have decided to explore and understand the gender disparity in the several sectors and explored the reasons and effects right from the roots of this problem. 

Data Description:
For my project, I have collected the dataset from Kaggle, Data world, World population review, Our world in data, and from a few other sources. I gathered multiple datasets, investigated the variables affecting this difference in several sectors, and developed a story.

 Some of the multiple datasets that we have used in the project are described below:
 
1.	Corporate Employee Dataset: It has various variables like Salary, Education field, Job role, department, business travel, etc. with regards to gender.
2.	Sports Dataset: It shows the percentage of women participants and events hosted in Olympics over the years and the second sports data related to the Canada shows that the percentage of male and female participants in each of the Olympics.
3.	Politics Dataset: It shows the percentage of female seats in the parliament across the world for almost 113 countries.
4.	Education: It consists of male-female-literacy rates all over the world.
5.	Gender Wage Gap: It consists of the wage gap factor between men and women
